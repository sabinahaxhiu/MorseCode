# Morse Code 

As we know the Morse code assigns a series of dots and dashes to each letter of the alphabet, each digit, and
a few special characters.

This code helps you to convert the Morse code easily. 
You can easily convert  from English to Morse or vice versa

When you first open the code it will appear a question, 
where you will be able to choose  if you want to convert from English to Morse or vice versa.


Then write what you want to convert and it will be converted.




## Methods

- append()- is used to print the array

## Object
